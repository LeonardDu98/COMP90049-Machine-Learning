In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. However, in the real world, this assumption is extremely harsh and (almost) impossible to achieve. It's why we call it naive.\n",
    "    - (1) The basis of the naive Bayes classifier is the Bayes formula. If the naive assumption is not true, the solution of the joint probability in the Bayesian formula is almost impossible. Bayesian formula no longer exists.\n",
    "    - (2) In our data set, there are 30 features. If the features are not independent, we need to calculate the joint probability distribution of 29 features (another feature is a label). Each feature has multiple values, which is a 29-dimensional spatial distribution. Even with the current computing power, when the amount of data is large, it is extremely difficult to calculate the joint probability simply by statistics. Besides, even if we can count the joint probability, due to the sparseness of the data, the data cannot contain all the combinations of features. Many of the statistical probabilities are 0, and it is difficult for the classifier to deal with this situation."

And, when 'absences' is 'four_to_six', the predictions are almost incorrect. However, when the 'absences' is 'none', only half of the predictions are correct.

    "    - (ii) There are many advantages to K-fold cross-validation. At first, due to sample variability between training and test set, our model usually gives a better prediction on training data but fail to generalize on test data which is called overfitting. However, for K-fold cross-validation, we create much different training data and test data. The model is always more accurate. Besides, when we split the dataset into training and test set, we use only a subset of data. The training result depends largely on the quality of random sets. Using K-fold cross-validation can reduced bias. Usually, we choose K equal to 5 or 10. Since our data set is really small, large K maybe lead to overfitting, I let K equal to 5 in my code."

At first, the accuracies in Q1 and Q3 are both in [0.3, 0.4]. One reasonable explanation is that Naive Bayes has limited ability to process this data set. Besides, the accuracy in Q3 is larger than in Q1. Since we divide data into 5 parts and train the model by 5 different data, the accuracy in Q3 is more universal. Finally, the result is random because we chose different data every time under the hold-out strategy. But the result in Q3 is constant because KFold.split () function splits the data in the same way.b I implement the 5-Kold cross-validation strategy using above code."

Even after removing all the unethical data, the remaining data is more or less related to the unethical data. Therefore, it is still not a fair classifier. Secondly, whether the data is ethical depends on my subjective judgment, and personal judgment cannot be unbiased in many cases. Finally, the classifier removes unethical data, but there are still a lot of interference data in the collection, which may produce white noise. For example, the quality of family relationships and grade are clearly irrelevant.\n",
